## Overview

### Project Outline

This was my first project after I decided to start taking coding seriously. It's a simple resizable Etch-a-Sketch for the desk top.

### Current/Continued Development

- What would I like to do to improve the project in the future?
  I might build another version that also works on touch screens and resizes for mobile, but this one will never change. It's a reminder of where I started, and the excitement of working out a complex coding problem on my own. (It was complex at the time, and when I say on my own I mean with liberal use of Google ;P )

## My Process

### Built With

HTML, CSS, JS

### What I Learned

That coding is fun!
